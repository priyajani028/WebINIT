## NOTES

Why you need authentication?

-> As different users come, we should be able to find them uniquely to do certain required tasks/ requests.

-> We create am account for each user, so that each time that user can login and can do whatever he/she wants to.

-> Another use, To restrict access , once user pays, he/she can access some other services.
